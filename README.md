# PHP-DI integration with Slim

This package configures Slim to work with the [PHP-DI container](http://php-di.org/).  

This package updates [PHP-DI Slim Bridge](https://github.com/PHP-DI/Slim-Bridge) to support Psr\Container v2. It will no longer be maintained when and if the original package is updated.  

PHP-DI Slim Bridge has been updated to support Psr\Container v2 organically. There is no longer a need for this package to be maintained.
